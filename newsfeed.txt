-> Increase Life time item to 4h ( Battery Charged ) now will not spawn within the radius of the flag.
-> Increase Life time item to 4h ( Cable-red ) now will not spawn within the radius of the flag.

-> Decrease Spawn Head Torch
-> Decrease Life Time item ( PowerGenarator ) for 4 hours, within the radius of the flag he will not make despawn
-> Decrease Life Time item ( smallprotectivecase) for 4 hours, within the radius of the flag he will not male despawn

With these changes, I hope to give a more balance in the loot spawn by the map in some areas, thus giving possibility of other items can give spawn
